# MultiCriAna: Tool for Multi-Criteria Decision Making (Multi-Criteria Analyzer)

MultiCriAna is a simple Python script designed to facilitate multi-criteria decision-making using the weighted sum method. This tool allows users to evaluate various alternatives based on multiple criteria and determine the most suitable option.

# How It Works

1. Functionality: The script provides a function `weighted_sum_decision` that performs multi-criteria decision analysis. It takes criteria weights and scores of alternatives as inputs and returns final scores for each alternative.

2. User Input: Users are prompted to enter the number of alternatives and criteria, along with their names, weights, and scores. The criteria weights represent the importance of each criterion, while the scores reflect how well each alternative meets the criteria.

3. Calculation: The script normalizes the weights, calculates the final scores for each alternative using the weighted sum method, and displays the results.

# Usage Instructions

1. Installation: Simply download the `multi_criteria_decision.py` script and run it using Python.

2. Input: Follow the prompts to enter the number of alternatives, criteria, their names, weights, and scores.

	- Enter the number of alternatives: First, the program will ask you to specify how many options you want to compare. These options are called 'alternatives' For example, if you're deciding between having pizza, a burger, or a salad for lunch, each of these choices would be considered an alternative.

	- Enter the number of criteria: Next, the program will inquire about the number of criteria. Criteria are simply the attributes that will help you evaluate each alternative. For instance, when choosing what to have for lunch, you might consider taste, price, healthiness, etc. Each of these criteria is one aspect that we can assess.

	- Enter the names and weights of the criteria: Now, you'll input names for each criterion and their respective weights. Weights determine how important each criterion is to you. For example, if health is your top priority, you might assign a higher weight to that criterion.

	- Enter the names and ratings for each alternative: You'll then provide names for each alternative along with their ratings for each criterion. This allows us to assess how each alternative fares against our criteria. We rate each alternative for each criterion on a scale from 1 to 10.

3. Output: The script will calculate and display the final scores for each alternative, sorted from least to most important. The alternative with the highest score will be highlighted.

	- Analyzing the results: Now that you have all the information, you can make a well-informed decision! Review the results and consider which option aligns best with your needs and preferences.

That's it! You're now equipped to use MultiCriAna to make better decisions. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your decision-making!
